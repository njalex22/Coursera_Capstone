    "The audience is a hospitality company that manages many restaurants around the US. This company wants to open a new restaurant and maximize the likelihood of the success of this restaurant. This analysis will recommend a location to open up a restaurant. This project takes on a broad scope in that is considers all major cities in the country. I will first identify the vibrant, up and coming cities as the first filter for narrowing the candidates. Of those cities, I will identify which cities may be underserved, from a gastronomic perspective. Next, I will choose one city, and identify which types of restaurants might add an exciting new element to their restaurant scene. Finally, I will conduct location-based clustering and recommend a specific cluster associated with a location to open in the target city."

    "Three different data sources will be utilized. First, data from the largest cities in the US is scraped from Wikipedia. Next, the zip codes from the filtered cities is downloaded from a Zip Code API web service. Once all the zip codes for each city have been obtained, they will be appended with their corresponding latitude and longitude. Finally, the venues associated with these zip codes will be extracted from Foursquare. The data from Foursquare will be analyzed to make the final recommendation."
